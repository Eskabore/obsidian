DO NOT COMMIT THESE CREDENTIALS. To use them in your code, follow these steps:

1.  Create a file named .gitignore in your project folder
2.  List in your .gitignore file the name of the JSON file you will put the credentials in (e.g., secrets.json)
3.  Create the JSON file whose name you put in .gitignore and put the credentials into it
4.  In your app code, require the JSON file to get the credentials when you need them

If you accidentally commit the credentials or cause them to be compromised in some other way, please alert a teacher type immediately.
