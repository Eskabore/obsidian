# Countdown

-   Create a new directory named 'countdown' containing two js files, index.js and countdown.js
    
-   In countdown.js create a constructor called `Countdown` and attach it to the module's `exports` object.
    
-   The `Countdown` constructor should expect one parameter, a positive number indicating the number of seconds to count down.
    
-   Instances of `Countdown` should inherit from `events.EventEmitter`. That is, instances of `Countdown` should have `events.EventEmitter.prototype` in their prototype chain.
    
-   When a countdown instance is created, it should emit a `secondElapsed` event every second until it gets to zero, passing the current number of seconds remaining to any listeners that have been added
    
-   In index.js, require the countdown module and create an instance of `Countdown` that counts down from 10. Add to the instance a listener for the `secondElapsed` event that logs to the console the number of seconds remaining followed by an exclamation point. When the number passed to the event listener is 0, log "lift off!" to the console instead of the number followed by an exclamation point. Your index.js should end up something like this:
    
    ```js
      const Countdown = require('./countdown').Countdown;
    
      const countdown = new Countdown(10);
    
      countdown.on('secondElapsed', function(timeLeft) {
          if (timeLeft > 0) {
              console.log(timeLeft);
          } else {
              console.log('lift off!');
          }
      });
    ```
    
    The console output should end up looking like this:
    
    ```
      10
      9
      8
      7
      6
      5
      4
      3
      2
      1
      lift off!
    ```
