## Working with the browser developer tools

As you check what your HTML looks like when the browser renders it, familiarize yourself with the browser's developer tools. They allow you to inspect your HTML and CSS and try out changes! If you're using Chrome, you can learn more about its dev tools [here](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/inspect-styles/?utm_source=dcc&utm_medium=redirect&utm_campaign=2016q3).

## Part 2

As a next step let's make our webpage display nicely on phones.

### Add a dark color scheme

Last but not least, let's look at how we can allow our users to pick a dark color scheme.

[Follow these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59223868) to toggle between light and dark mode in the developer tools.

**_NOTA BENE_**: You should not use `display: flex` or `display: grid` (or the inline versions thereof) for this project. We will discuss Flexbox and Grid in due course. For now, please stick to the techniques discussed [here](https://spiced.space/okra/css_positioning).
