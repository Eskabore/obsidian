# Image Upload

It is so common for websites to allow users to upload images that we should probably get some experience doing it.

## Node stuff

You should create a new Express project and add to it a directory named `uploads`.

You should also install the [multer](https://github.com/expressjs/multer) middleware.

```bash
npm install multer --save
```

To generate unique names for uploaded files, you can use [uid-safe](https://github.com/crypto-utils/uid-safe).

```bash
npm install uid-safe --save
```

Once these modules are installed, you need to `require` them and configure `multer` in your main module.

```js
const multer = require('multer');
const uidSafe = require('uid-safe');
const path = require('path');

const diskStorage = multer.diskStorage({
    destination: function (req, file, callback) {
        callback(null, path.join(__dirname, 'uploads'));
    },
    filename: function (req, file, callback) {
        uidSafe(24).then(function(uid) {
            callback(null, uid + path.extname(file.originalname));
        });
    }
});

const uploader = multer({
    storage: diskStorage,
    limits: {
        fileSize: 2097152
    }
});
```

In the example above, the object returned from the call to `multer.diskStorage` specifies functions that `multer` should use for determining the path and filename to use when saving files. The `destination` function tells `multer` to put files in the `uploads` directory **within the parent directory** of the file where this code will run. The `filename` function tells `multer` to use as the file name the unique id generated by the call to `uidSafe`, with the extension of the original file name appended to it. Please be aware that if you put this multer setup code into a separate file in a subdirectory, eg. a router file, you will need to make sure that the `uploads` directory can be found by this code.

The `diskStorage` object is then passed to `multer`, along with an object specifying a file size limit (2MB). It is a good idea to place such limits to prevent DOS attacks. The full list of limits you can apply is available [here](https://github.com/mscdex/busboy#busboy-methods)

The object returned from this call to `multer` has middleware functions attached to it that can be used to handle uploads on specific routes. You do not want to pass any of these functions to `app.use` because you only want to allow uploads on specific routes.

```js
app.post('/upload', uploader.single('file'), function(req, res) {
    // If nothing went wrong the file is already in the uploads directory
    if (req.file) {
        res.json({
            success: true
        });
    } else {
        res.json({
            success: false
        });
    }
});
```

The call to `single` indicates that we are only expecting one file. The string passed to `single` is the name of the field in the request.

## Browser stuff

To get started, we'll need an `<input>` element on our page whose `type` attribute has the value `"file"`.

```html
<input type="file" accept="image/*">
```

The `accept` attribute tells the browser to disallow files that are not images.

For a long time it was only possible to upload a file with a `<form>` but now you can skip the `<form>` and use the [`FormData` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) to send the file to the server. Here's how it works. First, you get the file the user has specified in the form:

```js
const file = myFileInput.files[0];
```

Then you create a `FormData` instance and `append` the file to it.

```js
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('file', file);
```

You can then send the `FormData` instance in a POST request. This is very easy to with `fetch`:

```js
fetch('/upload.json', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData
});
```

After the image has been uploaded, you can display it to the user, if you passed your `/uploads` directory to `express.static`. Then, include the path + filename of the new uploaded image in the JSON response you send back to the browser. This would be fine for a devlopment environment, but in a real world situation, you will want to [[S3|transfer the image to another location]] for permanent storage and not just keep it on the local disk.
