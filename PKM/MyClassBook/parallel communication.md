&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In *data transmission*, **parallel communication** is a <u>method of conveying multiple binary digits</u> (**bits**)<u> simultaneously</u>. 
It contrasts with [[serial communication]], which conveys only a single bit at a time; this distinction is one way of characterizing a communications link.

**NB**: The basic difference between a "_parallel_" and a "_serial_" communication channel is ==the number of electrical conductors used at the physical layer to convey bits==.
