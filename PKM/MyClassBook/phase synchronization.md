**Phase synchronization** is the process by which two or more cyclic signals tend to oscillate with a repeating sequence of relative phase angles.

Phase synchronisation is usually applied to two waveforms of the same frequency with identical phase angles with each cycle. 
However it can be applied if there is an integer relationship of frequency, such that the cyclic signals share a repeating sequence of phase angles over consecutive cycles.
