> A **distributed system** is a system whose components are located on different **networked computers**, which ==communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another==.

The components interact with one another in order to achieve a common goal. <u>Three(3) significant characteristics of distributed systems are</u>:
- concurrency of components,
- [[Clock synchronisation|lack of global clock]],
- independent failure of components.
