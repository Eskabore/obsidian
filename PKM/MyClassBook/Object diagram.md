# Object Diagram
Tags: #object #diagram 

**Object diagrams** can be described as _an instance of class diagram_. 
Thus, these diagrams are more close to real-life scenarios where we implement a system.

Object diagrams are a set of objects and their relationship is just like class diagrams. They also represent the static view of the system.

The usage of object diagrams is similar to class diagrams but they are <u>used to build **prototype of a system** from a practical perspective</u>.
