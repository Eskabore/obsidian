### What is a Class Diagram ?

Tags: #diagram #class #mermaid

>  "In software engineering, a class diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects." (_source_ Wikipedia)

> - Class diagram is a **static diagram**. It represents the static view of an application. Class diagram is not only used for visualizing, describing, and documenting different aspects of a system but also for constructing executable code of the software application.
> - Class diagram describes the **attributes** and **operations** of a class and also the **constraints imposed on the system**. The class diagrams are widely used in the modeling of object oriented systems because they are the **only UML diagrams, which can be mapped directly with object-oriented languages.** 
> - Class diagram shows a collection of *classes*, *interfaces*, *associations*, *collaborations*, and *constraints*. It is also known as a **structural diagram**.

### Purpose of Class Diagrams

The purpose of class diagram is to model the static view of an application. Class diagrams are the only diagrams which can be directly mapped with object-oriented languages and thus widely used at the time of construction.

UML diagrams like activity diagram, sequence diagram can only give the sequence flow of the application, however class diagram is a bit different. It is the most popular UML diagram in the coder community.

<u>The purpose of the class diagram can be summarized as </u>:

  -->  Analysis and design of the static view of an application.

  -->  Describe responsibilities of a system.

  -->  Base for component and deployment diagrams.

  -->   Forward and [[reverse engineering]].

### How to draw a Class Diagram ?

Class diagrams are the most popular [[UML diagrams]] used for construction of software applications. It is very important to learn the drawing procedure of class diagram.

Class diagrams have a lot of properties to consider while drawing but here the diagram will be considered from a top level view.

Class diagram is basically a graphical representation of the static view of the system and represents different aspects of the application. A collection of class diagrams represent the whole system.
