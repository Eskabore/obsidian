**Connection-oriented communication** is a network communication mode in telecommunications and computer networking, where a <u>communication session</u> or a <u>semi-permanent connection</u> is established ==before any useful data can be transferred==, enabling the ability to ensure that data is delivered in the correct order to the upper communication layer.

**Connection-oriented communication** may be a "_circuit switched_" connection, or a "_packet-mode virtual circuit_" connection.
 > In the latter case, it may use either a **transport layer virtual circuit protocol** such as the [[Def08.10#Transmission Control Protocol|Transmission Control Protocol]], allowing data to be delivered in order.
