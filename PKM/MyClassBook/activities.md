# Activities
Tags: #activity #activities #ULM #diagram  An activity in Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a major task that must take place in order to fulfill an operation contract.

<u>NB</u>: The [[Student Guide to Object-Oriented Development]] defines an activity as a sequence of activities that make up a process. 
==> Activities can be represented in [[activity diagrams]].

An activity can represent: 
- The invocation of an operation.
-  A step in a [[business process]].
-  An **entire** business process.
    
!--- The underlying conception of an activity has changed between UML 1.5 and UML 2.0.
---

|-> In **UML 2.0 an activity is no longer based on the state-chart** rather **<u>it is based on a</u> [[Petri net]]** like coordination mechanism.
There the activity represents user-defined behavior coordinating actions. 
|---> Actions in turn are pre-defined (UML offers a series of actions for this).
