&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A **communication channel** refers either to a physical transmission medium such as a wire, or to a [[Connection-oriented communication|logical connection]] over a [[multiplexed]] medium such as a radio channel in telecommunications and computer networking. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A channel is used to convey an information signal, for example a digital bit stream, from one or several senders (or transmitters) to one or several receivers. A channel has a certain capacity for transmitting information, often measured by its **bandwidth in Hz** or its **data rate in bits per second**.
