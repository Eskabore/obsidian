# Computer Architecture

In [[computer engineering]], computer architecture is a set of rules and methods that describe the **functionality**, **organization**, and **implementation** of computer systems. Some definitions of architecture define it as describing the capabilities and programming model of a computer but not a particular implementation[^1].

In other definitions computer architecture involves instruction set architecture design, microarchitecture design, logic design, and implementation.

"Architecture describes the internal organization of a computer in an abstract way; that is, it defines the capabilities of the computer and its programming model. You can have two computers that have been constructed in different ways with different technologies but with the same architecture."
