# Shared medium
Tags: #telecommunications #channel 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  In telecommunication, a **shared medium** is a _**medium**_ or _**channel of information transfer**_ that <u>serves more than one user at the same time</u>.
--> Most channels only function correctly when one user is transmitting, so a channel access method is always in effect.
