# Unified Modeling Language
Tags: #UML #language 

The **Unified Modeling Language** (**UML**) is a general-purpose, developmental, modeling language in the field of software engineering that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.

## Design
---
UML offers a way to visualize a system's architectural blueprints in a diagram, including elements such as:
- any [[activities]] (jobs);
- individual components of the system;
     - and how they can interact with other software components;
- how the system will run;
- how entities interact with others (components and interfaces);
- external user interface.

lthough originally intended for object-oriented design documentation, UML has been extended to a larger set of design documentation.
