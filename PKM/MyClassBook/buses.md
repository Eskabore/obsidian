# Bus
(COMPUTING)

Tags: #bus #computer #architecture

In [[computer architecture]], a bus, - historically also called _data highway_-, is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers. This expression covers all related hardware components (wire, optical fibre, etc.) and software, including commmunication protocols.

 The term is now used for any physical arrangement that provides the same logical function as a parallel electrical bus.
