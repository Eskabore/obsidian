# Packet switching
Tags: #telecommunications #data 

In telecommunications, packet switching is a method of grouping data that is transmitted over a digital network into packets. Packets are made of a header and a [[payload]]. Data in the header is used by networking hardware to direct the packet to its destination, where the payload is extracted and used by [[application software]]. Packet switching is the primary basis for data communications in computer networks worldwide.
