Tags: #workflow 

A workflow management system (WfMS or WFMS) provides an infrastructure for the set-up, performance and monitoring of a defined sequence of tasks, arranged as a workflow application.

## Categories
Components or subsystems of WfMS can be categorized into the following categories:

   - **_Routing system_** (traffic policemen)

        This is the basic function of a WfMS. It conduces to the routing of the flow of information or document flow, it transmits the information from one work item to the next one. 
        NB: This feature will not respond to exceptional circumstances.

   - **_Distribution system_** (cox)

        This function is an expansion. It detects exceptional circumstances and transmits the information to designated work positions. With a dynamic assignment, it can assign new tasks to underworked positions, to achieve a continuation or a balance of workload within the workflow.

   - **_Coordination system_** (foreman)

        This function coordinates concurrent activities, to prevent resource conflicts or priority conflicts.

   - **_Agent system_** (labourer)

        This function does legwork automatically. This relieves the executing instance of operations which need no decisions.

   - **_Assistant system_** (expert)

        This feature extends the previous features to a process adjustment instance and for proposals for further actions. The basics are methods of artificial intelligence.
