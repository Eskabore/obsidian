**Systems engineering** is an [[interdisciplinary]] field of engineering and engineering management that focuses on how to design, integrate, and manage **complex systems** over their **life cycles**.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp At its core, **systems engineering** utilizes **_systems thinking principles_** to organize this body of knowledge. The individual outcome of such efforts, *an engineered system*, can be defined as a combination of components that work in synergy to collectively perform a useful function.

Issues such as requirements engineering, reliability, logistics, coordination of different teams, testing and evaluation, maintainability and many other disciplines necessary for successful system design, development, implementation, and ultimate decommission become more difficult when dealing with large or complex projects. 
Systems engineering deals with **work-processes**, **optimization methods**, and** risk management tools** in such projects. It overlaps technical and human-centered disciplines such as industrial engineering, process systems engineering, mechanical engineering, manufacturing engineering, production engineering, control engineering, software engineering, electrical engineering, cybernetics, aerospace engineering, organizational studies, civil engineering and project management. Systems engineering ensures that all likely aspects of a project or system are considered and integrated into a whole.

The systems engineering process is a <u>discovery process that is quite unlike a **manufacturing process**</u>. 
--> A **manufacturing process** is _focused on repetitive activities that achieve high quality outputs with minimum cost and time_.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp ``` WHILST ```

-->The **systems engineering process** must _begin by discovering the real problems that need to be resolved, and identifying the most probable or highest impact failures that can occur_ â€“ systems engineering involves finding solutions to these problems.
