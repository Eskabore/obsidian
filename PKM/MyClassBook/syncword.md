&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In computer networks, a **syncword**, **sync character**, **sync sequence** or **_preamble_** is used to <u>synchronize a data transmission by indicating the end of header information and the start of data</u>.
The **syncword** is a known sequence of data used to identify the start of a frame, and is also called reference signal or **_midamble_** in wireless communications.

**Prefix codes** allow unambiguous identification of synchronization sequences and may serve as _self-synchronizing code_.
