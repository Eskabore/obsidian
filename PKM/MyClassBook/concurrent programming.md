# Concurrent computing
Tags: #concurrent #computing #programming 

**Concurrent computing** is a form of computing in which several computations are executed *concurrently*—during overlapping time periods—instead of *sequentially*, with one completing before the next starts.

This is a property of a system—whether a program, computer, or a network—where there is a **separate** <u>execution point</u> or <u>"thread of control"</u> for each process. 
-->  A **concurrent system** is one where a computation can advance without waiting for all other computations to complete.

**Concurrent computing** is a form of [[modular programming]]. In its [[paradigm]] an overall computation is factored into subcomputations that may be executed concurrently.
