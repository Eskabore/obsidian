## Definitions  Metaphores Comparaisons

－A communication protocol is a system of rules that allow two or more entities of a communications system to transmit information via any kind of variation of a physical quantity. The protocol defines the rules, syntax, semantics and synchronization of communication and possible error recovery methods. Protocols may be implemented by hardware, software, or a combination of both.

－Protocols are to communication what algorithms are to computation.

- Messages are sent and received on communicating systems to establish communication. Protocols should therefore specify rules governing the transmission. 
In general, much of the following should be addressed:

> - Data formats for data exchange
> - Address formats for data exchange
> - Address mapping
> - Routing (When systems are not directly connected)
> - Detection of transmission errors
> - Acknowledgements (connection-oriented communication)
> - Loss of information :
Timeouts & Retries (Optional)
> - Direction of information flow
> - Sequence control
> - Flow control
> - Queuing
