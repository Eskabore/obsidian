**_Execution_** in computer and software engineering is the process by which a computer or virtual machine executes the instructions of a computer program. <br>Each instruction of a program is a description of a particular action which to be carried out in order for a specific problem to be solved; as instructions of a program and therefore the actions they describe are being carried out by an executing machine, specific effects are produced in accordance to the **semantics of the instructions** being executed.

Programs for a computer may be executed in a **batch process** without human interaction or a user may type commands in an interactive session of an **interpreter**[^intr]. In this case, the "commands" are simply program instructions, whose execution is chained together.

  [^intr]: In computer science, an interpreter is a computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program. An interpreter generally uses one of the following strategies for program execution: 1.**Parse** the source code and perform its behavior directly;
            2.**Translate** source code into some efficient intermediate representation and immediately execute this; 
            3.Explicitly **execute stored precompiled code**[^1] made by a compiler which is part of the interpreter system.

[^1]: _In this sense, the **CPU** is also an interpreter, of machine instructions.__
