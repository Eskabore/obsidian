- [Asynchrony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony_(computer_programming)): Asynchrony, in computer programming, refers to the occurrence of events independent of the main program flow and ways to deal with such events. These may be "outside" events such as the arrival of signals, or actions instigated by a program that take place concurrently with program execution, without the program blocking to wait for results.<br> Asynchronous input/output is an example of the latter cause of asynchrony, and lets programs issue commands to storage or network devices that service these requests while the processor continues executing the program. Doing so provides a degree of **parallelism**.

- [Operational Semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_semantics): Operational semantics is a category of formal programming language semantics in which certain desired properties of a program, such as correctness, safety or security, are verified by constructing proofs from logical statements about its execution and procedures, rather than by attaching mathematical meanings to its terms (**denotational semantics**[^den]).

[^den]: In computer science, denotational semantics (initially known as mathematical semantics or Scottâ€“Strachey semantics) is an approach of formalizing the meanings of programming languages by constructing mathematical objects (called denotations) that describe the meanings of expressions from the languages.


 -  [Subroutine ](https://obsidian.md/pricing):  is a sequence of program instructions that performs a specific task, packaged as a unit. This unit can then be used in programs wherever that particular task should be performed. [[Function - programming|Subroutine]] may be defined within programs, or separately in libraries that can be used by many programs. 
 > In different programming languages, a subroutine may be called a routine, subprogram, function, method, or procedure. Technically, these terms all have different definitions. The generic, umbrella term callable unit is sometimes used
