#### [Layering] 
<strong><u>Layering:</u></strong>  In  _modern protocol design_, protocols are layered to form a **protocol stack**. <br><p>Layering is a design principle that divides the protocol design task into smaller steps, each of which accomplishes a specific part, interacting with the other parts of the protocol only in a small number of well-defined ways.</p> Layering allows the parts of a protocol to be designed and tested without a combinatorial explosion of cases, keeping each design relatively simple.
