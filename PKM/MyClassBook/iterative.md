# Iterative
**Iterative** development is the process of reapeating and refining a cycle/way of working. This is called an **_iteration_**.

 **_Ex: An artist painting a picture_**
--> If the picture was painted *iteratively*, but not incrementally, the artist might start with a sketch of the finished image (a prototype). Then the artist would iteratively add paint to the drawing over time.  The artist would revisit the picture, changing it until he was happy with the finished image.
