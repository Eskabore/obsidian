# Interface
(COMPUTING)

Tags: #Interface 

In computing, an **interface** is a shared boundary across which two or more separate components of a computer system exchange information. The exchange can be between **software**, **computer hardware**, **peripheral** devices, humans, and combinations of these.[1] Some computer hardware devices, such as a touchscreen, can both send and receive data through the interface, while others such as a mouse or microphone may only provide an interface to send data to a given system.

## Hardware interfaces
Hardware interfaces exist in many of the components, such as the various **[[buses]]**, **storage devices**, other **I/O** devices, etc. A hardware interface is described by the mechanical, electrical and logical signals at the interface and the protocol for sequencing them (sometimes called signaling).[3] A standard interface, such as SCSI, decouples the design and introduction of computing hardware, such as I/O devices, from the design and introduction of other components of a computing system, thereby allowing users and manufacturers great flexibility in the implementation of computing systems.[3] Hardware interfaces can be parallel with several electrical connections carrying parts of the data simultaneously, or serial where data are sent one bit at a time.

In computer architecture, a bus, - historically also called _data highway_-, is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers. This expression covers all related hardware components (wire, optical fibre, etc.) and software, including commmunication protocols.
