# Payload
(COMPUTING)

Tags: #computing #telecommunications #data 

In computing and telecommunications, the **payload**[^1] is the part of **_transmitted data that is the actual intended message_**. 
<u>Headers</u> and <u>metadata</u> are sent only to enable payload delivery.

> In the context of a **computer virus** or **worm**, the **payload** is the portion of the malware which performs malicious action.

[^1]:The term is borrowed from transportation, where payload refers to the part of the load that pays for transportation.

## Programming
In [[computer programming]], the most common usage of the term is in the context of message protocols, to differentiate the protocol overhead from the actual data. For example, a JSON web service response might be: 
```md
{ "data": { "message": "Hello, world!" } }
```
The string _Hello, world!_ is the payload of JSON message, while the rest is protocol overhead
