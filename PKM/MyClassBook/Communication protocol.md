# Networking Protocol

Tags: #network #protocol #communication #telecommunications 
A **communication protocol** is a system of rules that allow two or more entities of a **communications system** to transmit information via any kind of variation of a physical quantity.

The protocol defines the **_rules_**, **_syntax_**, **_semantics_** and **_synchronization_** of <u>communication and possible error recovery methods</u>.
> **Protocols** may be implemented by hardware, software, or a combination of both.

**Communicating systems** use well-defined formats for exchanging various messages. Each message has an exact meaning intended to 'elicit' a response from a range of possible responses pre-determined for that particular situation. 
The specified behavior is typically independent of how it is to be implemented. 

**Communication protocols** have to be agreed upon by the parties involved.  
To reach an agreement, a protocol may be developed into a 'technical standard'.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; A **programming language** describes the same for computations, so there is a close analogy between protocols and [[Programming language|programming languages]]: 
 protocols are to communication what programming languages are to computations.
