# Serial communication

In  telecommunications and data  transmission, **serial communication** is the process  of **sending data one (1) bit at a time**, sequentially, over a [[communication channel]] or [[buses|computer bus]].
This is in contrast to [[parallel communication]], where several bits are sent as a whole, on a link with several parallel channels.

**Serial communication** is used for all _long-haul_ communication and most computer networks, where the cost of cable and synchronization difficulties make [[parallel communication]] impractical.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Serial computer buses** are becoming more common even at shorter distances, as improved signal integrity and transmission speeds in newer serial technologies have begun to outweigh the parallel bus's advantage of simplicity (no need for _**serializer**_ and _**deserializer**_, or **SerDes**) and to outstrip its disadvantages (_'clock skew'_, interconnect density).
