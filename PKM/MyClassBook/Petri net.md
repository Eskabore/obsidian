 A **Petri net**, also known as a **place/transition (PT) net**, is one of several _mathematical modeling languages_ for the description of [[distributed systems]]. It is _a class of discrete event dynamic system_. 
 
 <u>A Petri net</u> is a _**directed bipartite graph**_ that has **two types of elements**, **places** and **transition**s, depicted as white circles and rectangles, respectively. 
 A place can contain any number of tokens, depicted as *black circles*. <br>A transition is enabled if all places connected to it as inputs contain at least one token.<br> Some sources state that Petri nets were invented in August 1939 by Carl Adam Petri—at the age of 13—for the purpose of describing chemical processes.

Like industry standards such as [[UML activity diagrams]], [[Business Process Model]] and [[Notation and event-driven process chain|Notation and event-driven process chains]], Petri nets offer a graphical notation for stepwise processes that include choice, iteration, and concurrent execution. Unlike these standards, Petri nets have an exact mathematical definition of their execution semantics, with a well-developed mathematical theory for process analysis
