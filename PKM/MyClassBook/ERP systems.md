&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Enterprise resource planning** (**ERP**) is ==the integrated management of main [[business process|business processes]]==, often in real time and mediated by software and technology.

**ERP** is usually referred to as a category of **business management software**—typically a suite of integrated applications—that an organization can use to <u>collect, store, manage, and interpret data</u> from many business activities.

ERP provides an integrated and continuously updated view of core business processes using common databases maintained by a database management system. ERP systems track business resources—cash, raw materials, production capacity—and the status of business commitments: orders, purchase orders, and payroll. The applications that make up the system share data across various departments (manufacturing, purchasing, sales, accounting, etc.) that provide the data.[1] ERP facilitates information flow between all business functions and manages connections to outside stakeholders.

> Enterprise system software is a multibillion-dollar industry that produces components supporting a variety of business functions. IT investments have, as of 2011, become one of the largest categories of capital expenditure in United States-based businesses. Though early ERP systems focused on large enterprises, smaller enterprises increasingly use ERP systems.

!----The **ERP system** integrates varied organizational systems and facilitates error-free transactions and production, thereby enhancing the organization's efficiency. However, developing an ERP system differs from traditional system development.
