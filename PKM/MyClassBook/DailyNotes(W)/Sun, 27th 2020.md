### Polyfill (programming)
In [web development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development "Web development"), a **polyfill** is code that implements a feature on [web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser "Web browser") that do not support the feature. Most often, it refers to a [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript "JavaScript") [library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing) "Library (computing)") that implements an [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5 "HTML5") [web standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_standard "Web standard"), either an established standard (supported by some browsers) on older browsers, or a proposed standard (not supported by any browsers) on existing browsers. Formally, "a polyfill is a [shim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_(computing) "Shim (computing)") for a browser [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface "Application programming interface")".[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill_(programming)#cite_note-speakingjs-1)

Polyfills allow web developers to use an API regardless of whether or not it is supported by a browser, and usually with minimal overhead. Typically they first check if a browser supports an API, and use it if available, otherwise using their own implementation.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill_(programming)#cite_note-speakingjs-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill_(programming)#cite_note-2) Polyfills themselves use other, more supported features, and thus different polyfills may be needed for different browsers. The term is also used as a verb: _polyfilling_ is providing a polyfill for a feature.

### Shim (computing)
In [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming "Computer programming"), a **shim** is a [library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computer_science) "Library (computer science)") that [transparently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(human%E2%80%93computer_interaction) "Transparency (humanâ€“computer interaction)") intercepts [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface "Application programming interface") calls and changes the arguments passed, handles the operation itself or redirects the operation elsewhere.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_(computing)#cite_note-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_(computing)#cite_note-2) Shims can be used to support an old API in a newer environment, or a new API in an older environment. 
Shims can also be used for running programs on different software platforms than they were developed for.

Shims for older APIs typically come about when the behavior of an API changes, thereby causing compatibility issues for older applications which still rely on the older functionality; in such cases, the older API can still be supported by a thin **[compatibility layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibility_layer "Compatibility layer")** on top of the newer code. Shims for newer APIs are defined as: ***"a [library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing) "Library (computing)") that brings a new API to an older environment, using only the means of that environment."***
