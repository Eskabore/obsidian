## Standard Diagrams

We prepare **UML diagrams** to _understand the system in a **better** and **simple way**_.

UML defines various kinds of diagrams to cover most of the aspects of a system.

<u>NB</u>:_Diagrams are generally made in an [[incremental]] and [[iterative]] way_.

There are **two broad categories of diagrams** and they are again divided into subcategories:

   - [[Structural Diagrams]]

  -  Behavioral Diagrams
