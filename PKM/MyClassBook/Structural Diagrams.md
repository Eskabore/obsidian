# Structural Diagrams
Tags: #structural #diagram 

The **Structural diagrams** represent the ==static aspect of the system==.
These static aspects represent those parts of a diagram, which forms the main structure and are therefore stable.

These static parts are represented by **classes**, **interfaces**, **objects**, **components**, and **nodes**. 
The four (4) structural diagrams are:
- [[Class Diagrams|Class Diagram]][^1]
- [[Object diagram]]
- [[Component diagram]]
- [[Deployment diagram]]

[^1] Class diagrams are the most common diagrams used in UML. Class diagrams basically represent the **object-oriented view of a system**, <u>which is static in nature</u>.
