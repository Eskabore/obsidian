# Workflow
Tags: #workflow #process #management #systems 

A **workflow** consists of <span style="background-color:darkgreen">an orchestrated and repeatable pattern of activity, enabled by the systematic organization of resources into processes that transform materials, provide services, or process information</span>.
--> It can be depicted as   _a sequence of operations, the work of a person or group; the work of an organization of staff; or one or more simple or complex mechanisms_.

From a more "abstract" or "higher-level" perspective, workflow may be considered a view or representation of real work.
The flow being described may refer to a document, service, or product that is being transferred from one step to another.

Workflows may be viewed as one fundamental building block to be combined with other parts of an organization's structure such as **information technology**, **teams**, **projects** and **hierarchies**.

## Workflow management system

A [[workflow management system]] (**WfMS**) is a software system for setting up, performing, and monitoring of a defined sequence of processes and tasks, with the broad goals of increasing productivity, reducing costs, becoming more agile, and improving information exchange within an organization.
    --> These systems may be **process-centric** or **data-centric**, and they may represent the workflow as _graphical maps_. 
    !--- The workflow management system may also include an extensible interface so that external software applications can be integrated and provide support for wide area workflows that provide faster response times and improved productivity.


### Related concepts

The concept of workflow is closely related to several fields in operations research and other areas that study the nature of work, either quantitatively or qualitatively, such as artificial intelligence (in particular, the sub-discipline of AI planning) and ethnography. The term "workflow" is more commonly used in particular industries, such as in printing or professional domains such as clinical laboratories, where it may have particular specialized meanings.

 - **Processes**: A process is a more general notion than workflow and can apply to, for example, physical or biological processes, whereas a workflow is typically a process or collection of processes described in the context of work, such as all processes occurring in a machine shop.

 - **Planning and scheduling**: A plan is a description of the logically necessary, partially ordered set of activities required to accomplish a specific goal given certain starting conditions. A plan, when augmented with a schedule and resource allocation calculations, completely defines a particular instance of systematic processing in pursuit of a goal. A workflow may be viewed as an often optimal or near-optimal realization of the mechanisms required to execute the same plan repeatedly.
 
 - **Flow control**: This is a control concept applied to workflows, to distinguish from static control of buffers of material or orders, to mean a more dynamic control of flow speed and flow volumes in motion and in process. Such orientation to dynamic aspects is the basic foundation to prepare for more advanced job shop controls, such as just-in-time or just-in-sequence.
 
 - **In-transit visibility**: This monitoring concept applies to transported material as well as to work in process or work in progress, i.e., workflows.
