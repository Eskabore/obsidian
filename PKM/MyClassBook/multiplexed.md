&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In telecommunications and computer networks, **multiplexing** (sometimes contracted to _muxing_) is a method by which <u>multiple analog or digital signals are combined into one signal over a </u>[[shared medium]].
The aim is to share a scarce resource. 
 * **Ex**: in telecommunications, several **telephone calls** may be carried using one wire.
