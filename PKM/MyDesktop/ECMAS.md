## Review

This is what I should have achieved or completed {{yesterday}}determine how each property can be used


  ##### _Properties_ 
  are containers that hold other objects, _primitive values_, or _functions_.
  
  ##### _A primitive value _
  is a member of one of the following built-in types: **Undefined**, **Null**, **Boolean**, **Number**, **BigInt**, **String**, and **Symbol**

  ##### _An attribute_
  extends an [element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/element), changing its behavior or providing metadata.
       * An attribute always has the formÂ `name="value"` (the attribute's identifier followed by its associated value).
       * An attribute without the equal sign or a value is a shorthand for providing an empty string in HTML, or the attribute's name in XML.  (*Source:MDN*)
