## Object-oriented programming
in **OOP*, an  _*instance*_ is a <u>concrete occurrence of any object existing during the runtime of a computer program</u>.<br>*Formally*, "instance" is synonymous with "object" as they are each a particular value and these may be called an **instance object*[^instance].
> The creation of an instance is called **instantiation**.

[^instance]: "instance" emphasizes the distinct identity of the object.
