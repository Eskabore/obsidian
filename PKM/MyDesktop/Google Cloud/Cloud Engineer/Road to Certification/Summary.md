There are 8 people interested in joining the focused study group. I spent Sunday trying to figure out a lot of things concerning the group and also working on Qwiklabs.




 I would like to organize a zoom meeting with you all as soon as possible.
 We will define each and everyone level of experience and availability for weekly meetings.

The group will follow the participatory teaching methods of the "learning Pyramid":
- Discussion
- Practice by doing
- Teach others

We will use Notion to collaborate. - Passing the Cloud Engineer Certification by early next year -is considered a project. 
I subscribed to a plan so that we can edit live altogether and each of you will be able to organize Zoom calls at any point of the day with another member.

There is a lot of information to gather, process, and memorize. We will edit a Wiki where everyone will participate.
I am sure that together, we can create a Wiki with hyperlinks on Notion. For those who use Obsidian, you understand the advantages of building a "second brain". It will be a source where we can find all the information we need about the certification (definitions, paths, visual explanations of GCloud concepts,... ).

We could also decide on meeting in person (ex: at my place the living room is big enough) and self given tasks
