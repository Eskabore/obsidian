- In Lightning Experience, subfolders can be used to organize reports and dashboards into a logical structure. Folder sharing is at the root level, not subfolder level. Subfolders can be created in user created folders, but not in the Public or Private folder. Folders can be renamed or deleted (if the folder doesn't contain any reports or dashboards).

- Change sets can only be sent between orgs that are connected to a single production org, such as two sandboxes of a production org or a sandbox and its production org.

- For migrating metadata from one org environment to a different org, other tools can be used such as VS Code or Ant migration tool.
