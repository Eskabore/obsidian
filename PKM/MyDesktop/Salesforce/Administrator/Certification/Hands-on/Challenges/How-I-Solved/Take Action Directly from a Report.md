# How I Solved This: Take Action Directly from a Report

### Key business problem
I want my users to take action on a list of records returned in a report, and not a list view. It’s easy to edit records in a list view, but to make changes to what’s in the report takes more effort—to open each record into a new tab or window and edit it. That’s time-consuming and tedious for users.
