# How I Solved This: List Views for Object Ownership
Link to [webpage](https://admin.salesforce.com/blog/2020/how-i-solved-this-list-views-for-object-ownership)

### Key Business Problem:

I want to create a List View to show a user only the Custom Object records for which they are responsible, but they may not be the owner of the record. The “My Record” functionality is based solely on ownership of the record, so how can we create useful List Views for each user without the “My…” capability?
