#### Permissions Set Group
Permission Set Groups bundle permission sets together. Users assigned to a permission set group receive the combined permissions of all the permission sets in the group. Permission set groups correspond to the job functions of users. 
- Just like with permission sets, you cannot assign a user to a permission set group if their license does not permit the permissions you want to assign.
  Licensing requirements remain the same when you work with permission set groups.

#### Principle of least privilege
Users should have the least permissions necessary to do their job.
We keep this principle in mind as we work with permission set/groups.
