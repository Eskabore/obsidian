## Introduction to Creating Visualforce Pages

Visualforce pages are basic building blocks for application developers. A Visualforce page is similar to a standard Web page, but includes powerful features to access, display, and update your organization’s data. Pages can be referenced and invoked via a unique URL, just as they would be on a traditional web server.

Visualforce uses a tag-based markup language that’s similar to HTML. Each Visualforce tag corresponds to a coarse or fine-grained user interface component, such as **a section of a page, a list view, or an individual field**. Visualforce boasts nearly 150 built-in components, and provides a way for developers to create their own components. Visualforce markup can be freely mixed with HTML markup, CSS styles, and JavaScript libraries, giving you considerable flexibility in how you implement your app’s user interface.

You can view, create, and edit Visualforce pages several different ways in Salesforce. Visualforce pages can also be created and modified using Salesforce APIs, enabling a variety of external tools.
