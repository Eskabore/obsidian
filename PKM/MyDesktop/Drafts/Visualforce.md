- List three or more places where Visualforce can be used.

## Introduction to Visualforce
Visualforce is a web development framework that enables developers to build sophisticated, custom user interfaces for mobile and desktop apps that can be hosted on the Lightning Platform. You can use Visualforce to build apps that align with the styling of Lightning Experience, as well as your own completely custom interface.
Visualforce enables developers to extend Salesforce’s built-in features, replace them with new functionality, and build completely new apps. Use powerful built-in standard controller features, **==or write your own custom business logic in Apex==**. You can build functionality for your own organization, or create apps for sale in the AppExchange.

Visualforce app development is familiar to anyone who has built web apps. Developers create Visualforce pages by composing components, HTML, and optional styling elements. Visualforce can integrate with any standard web technology or JavaScript framework to allow for a more animated and rich user interface.
