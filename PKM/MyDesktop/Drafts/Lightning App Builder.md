- Understand the layout of the Lightning App Builder user interface
- Describe the ==difference between a **Lightning page** and a **Lightning component**==

## How the Lightning App Builder Works
With the Lightning App Builder, you can build:

- Single-page apps that drill down into standard pages
- Dashboard-style apps, such as apps to track top sales prospects or key leads for the quarter
- “Point” apps to solve a particular task, such as an expense app for users to enter expenses and monitor expenses they’ve submitted
- Custom record pages for your objects, tailored to the needs of your users
- Custom Home pages containing the components and features that your users use most

You can create different types of Lightning pages with the Lightning App Builder. We're going to look at these three types.


### App Page
Use an app page to create a home page for a third-party app that you can add directly into the Salesforce mobile app and Lightning Experience navigation menus. Your users then have an app home page where they can quickly access the most important objects and items.

### Home Page
Create Home pages with features relevant to specific types of users, and assign the customized pages to different apps or app-and-user-profile combinations. Custom Home pages are supported in Lightning Experience only.

### Record Page
With a record page, you can create a customized version of an object’s record page, tailoring it to your users’ needs. Custom record pages are supported in Lightning Experience and in the Salesforce mobile app.
