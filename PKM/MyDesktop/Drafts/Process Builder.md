#process #workflow #salesforce 

Automates tasks using conditions and actions.
With Process Builder, you define **evaluation criteria**, determining which objects the rule you create applies to.
You establish the criteria that records must meet to trigger the rule. Then you set up **time triggers** that determine _when_ the process action fires.

Once your criteria are in place, immediate or time-dependent actions are set in motion.
These actions can include:
- creating a record, 
- updating a record, 
- sending an email, 
- posting to Chatter, 
- initiating a quick action, 
- submitting for approval, 
- launching a flow, or 
- calling an Apex class.
