# What’s a Case Team?

> A case team is **a group of people that work together to solve cases**. For example, a case team can include support agents, support managers, and product managers.

If your admin has set up case teams, you can add people to the Case Team related list on cases. When adding a team member, choose one of the predefined roles that the person plays on the case. Roles determine the level of access to a case, such as read-only or read and write access.

> **_You can add contacts to case teams_**, but **_==they can only access cases when they’re enabled as customer portal users==_** assigned to case page layouts. Customer portal users can’t update case teams or view case team roles. Case teams aren’t available for the partner portal.

> **Note**
Admins can predefine case teams so that you can quickly add people who you frequently work with. Admins can create assignment rules that add predefined teams to cases that match specific criteria. Admins can also create email alerts that notify team members when an action happens on a case.

> **Tip**
Tip To filter case lists when you’re a team member, choose My Case Teams. To report on case teams that you belong to, run a case report, then choose My team's cases from the View filter.
