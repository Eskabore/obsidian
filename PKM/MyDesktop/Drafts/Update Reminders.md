# Schedule Reminders to Update Opportunities
To ensure that your team is keeping their opportunities up to date, create an email containing a report of your teamâ€™s open opportunities. Schedule automatic reminder emails to your direct reports.

For example, schedule a weekly report of all the opportunities for the current fiscal quarter owned by anyone on the team. Have the report distributed to everyone on the team.

    Make sure that opportunity update reminders are enabled in Setup.
    In your personal settings, use the Quick Find box to find My Update Reminder.
    To start sending reminders after you save the settings, check Active.
    Enter a sender name and address.
    Choose recipients.
    Enter any other recipients in the CC field. Separate email addresses with commas, semicolons, spaces, or new lines.
    Enter a subject and message for the reminders.
    Schedule the frequency.
    Select To include all open opportunities that have a closing date within 90 days before the specified close date, select Include Past Due Opportunities.

    For example, suppose that in your org you use a normal fiscal year, and the current quarter started on April 1, 2012. You configure reminders for opportunities closing in the current quarter and then select Include Past Due Opportunities. When the reminder is sent on June 15, it includes all opportunities with a close date between April 1 and June 15. It also includes open opportunities with a close date between January 2 and April 1 (there are 91 days in Q1).
    Include opportunities with dates within that range by selecting a close date.
    Select fields to include in the reminders.
