**Programming paradigm** are a way to classify programming languages based on their features. Languages can be classified into *multiple paradigms*.

<u>**Common programming paradigms include:**</u>
   
  ##### imperative:
  in which the programmer instructs the machine how to change its state.
       - **procedural:** which groups instructions into procedures.
       - **object-oriented**: which groups instructions with the part of the [[State]] they operate on.


 ##### declarative: 
 in which the programmer merely declares properties of the desired result, but know how to compute it.
       - **functional:** in which the desired result is declared as the value of a series of function applications.
       - **logic:** in which the desired result is declared as the answer to a question about a system of facts and rules.
       - **mathematical**: in which the desired result is declared as the solution of an optimization problem.
