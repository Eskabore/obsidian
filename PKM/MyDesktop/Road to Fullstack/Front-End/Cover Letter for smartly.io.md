I was thinking of starting this email with a self introduction, however, after visiting your website, I'd rather begin with praises instead.

"smartly.io" appears to me as a forward-thinking company, with an  extreme focus on delivering "more than best" services to customers.

Today,while discovering about how your main product engineering teams work in sub-divided "mini-teams", I understood other advantages of a well designed MSA (Z-scaling here).

I code in React/Typescript and Node.JS, and my experience in client-side code and sessions API, could be a fit among one of your teams either for helping build internal tools or work on automatically generated creatives.
While working on a project, it matters to benefit from real-time communication of capacity and full transparency of work. That is why I enjoy working with Kanban physical boards and Jira software.

I would remain humble, as it is clear to me that there is so much more to learn about service delivery and teamwork in a company with such high expectations.

What I also find exciting, is how you define the scope of work, giving maximum freedom within strict borders.

Of course, I imagine that the first weeks would be about learning the company's coding standards, bug fixes, improving test coverage, and adjusting the team's pace.
Although, the bigger picture is proud, and self-satisfaction in achieving security, durability and maintainability.
