                    Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.
                    This page provides an introduction to the idea of components.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions.
                    They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>Functions and Class Components</h2>
                <p>
                    The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:
                    <pre data-language="javascript">
                        <code>
                        function Welcome(props) {
                        return Hello, {props.name};
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This fuction is a valid React component because it accepts a single "props" (which stands for properties)
                    object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components "function components"
                    because they are literally JavaScript functions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also use an
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes" name="ES6_class">
                        ES6 class
                    </a>
                    to define a component:
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            class Welcome extends Reacts.Component {
                                render() {
                                    return Hello, {this.props.name};
                                }
                            }
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    The above two components are equivalent from React's point of view.

                    React has a powerful composition model, and we recommend using composition instead of
                    Inheritance to reuse code between components.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this section, we will consider a few problems where developers new to React often
                    reach for inheritnce, and show how we can solve them with composition.

                <p>
                    Some components don't know their children ahead of time. This especially common for
                    components like <code>Sidebar</code> or <code>Dialog</code> that represent generic
                    boxes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We recommend that such components use the special <code>children</code> prop to pass children
                    elements directly into their output:
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            function WelcomeDialog() {
                                return (
                                    FancyBorder color="blue"
                                    h1 className="Dialog-title"
                                    Welcome
                                    /h1
                                    p className="Dialog-message"
                                    Thank you for visiting our spacecraft!
                                    /p
                                    /FancyBorder
                                    );                                )
                            }
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anything inside the <code>FancyBorder</code>JSX tag gets passed into the <code>FancyBorder</code>
                    component as a <code>children</code> prop. Since <code>FancyBorder</code> renders
                    <code>{props.children}</code> inside a <code>div</code>, the passed elements appear in the final
                    output.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While this is less common, sometimes you might need multiple "holes" in a component. In such cases
                    you may come up with your own convention instead of using <code>children</code>.
                </p>

                    In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need.
                    Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript.
                    Use JavaScript operators like <code>if</code> or the
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator" name="conditional_operator">
                        conditional operator
                    </a>
                    to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the Ui to match them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consider those two components:
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            // first component
                            function UserGreeting(props) {
                                return *h1*Welcome back!*h1*;
                              }
                            // Second component
                              function GuestGreeting(props) {
                                return *h1*Please sign up*h1*.</h1>;
                              }
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </p>
                <h3 id="element-variables">

                </h3>
                <p>
                    You can use variables to store elements. This can help you conditionally
                    render a part of the component while the rest of the output doesn not change.

                HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in React,
                because form elements naturally keep some internal state. For example, this
                form in plain HTML accepts a single name:
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        &lt;form&gt;
                            &lt;label&gt;
                              Name:
                              &lt;input type="text" name="name" /&gt;
                              &lt;/label&gt;
                              &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit" /&gt;
                              &lt;/form&gt;
                    </code>
                </pre>
                This form has the default HTML form behavior of browsing to a new page
                when the user submits the form. If you want this behavior in React,
                it just works. But in most cases, it is convenient to have a JavaScript function
                that handles the submission of the form and has access to the data
                that the user entered into the form. The standard way
                to achieve this is with a technique called “controlled components”.
            </p>
            <h2 id="controlled-components">
                Controlled Components
            </h2>
            <p>
                In HTML form elements such as <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>,
                and <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> typically maintain their own state and update it based on
                user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components,
                and only updated with <a href="https://devdocs.io/react/react-component#setstate">
                    <code>
                        setState()
                    </code>
                </a>
            </p>
            <p>
                We can combine the two by making the React state be the “single source of truth”.
                Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form
                on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled
                by React in this way is called a “controlled component”.

                Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements.
                There are some syntax differences:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, the HTML:
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        &lt;button onclick="activateLasers()"&gt;
                            Activate Lasers
                          &lt;/button&gt;
                    </code>
                </pre>
                is slightly different in React:
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        &lt;button onClick={activateLasers}&gt;
                            Activate Lasers
                          &lt;/button&gt;
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                Another difference is that you cannot return <pre><code>false</code></pre> to prevent
                default behavior in React. You must call <pre><code>preventDefautlt</code></pre>
                explicitly. For example, with plain HTML, to prevent the default form behavior of
                submitting, you can write:
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        &lt;form onsubmit="console.log('You clicked submit.'); return false"&gt;
                            &lt;button type="submit"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
                          &lt;/form&gt;
                    </code>
                </pre>
                In React this should be instead:
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        function Form() {
                            function handleSubmit(e) {
                              e.preventDefault();
                              console.log('You clicked submit.');
                            }

                            return (
                              &lt;form onSubmit={handleSubmit}&gt;
                                &lt;button type="submit"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
                              &lt;/form&gt;
                            );
                          }
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                Here, <pre><code>e</code></pre> is a synthetic event. React defines these synthetic events
                according to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/" name="W3C">W3C spec</a>,
                so you do not need to worry about cross-browser compatibility. React events do not work
                exactly th same as native events.
            </p>
            <p>
                When using React, you generally do not need to call <pre><code>addEventListener</code></pre> to
                add listeners to a DOM element after it is created. Instead, just provide a listener when the
                element is initially rendered.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you define a component using an ES6class, a common pattern is for an event handler to be

                    Consider this variable declaration:
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            const element = &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using
                    it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of
                    a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JSX produces React "elements".
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Why JSX
                </h3>
                <p>
                    React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI
                    logic:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            how events are handled
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            how the state changes over time
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            how the data is prepared for display
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead of artificiallyseparating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate
                    files, React <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Separation_of_concerns" name="separate-concerns">separates concerns
                    </a> with loosely coupled units called "components".
                </p>
                <p>
                    With that out of the way, let us get started!
