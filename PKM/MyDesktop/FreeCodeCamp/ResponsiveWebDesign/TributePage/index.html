        Tribute Info about the character
    </h2>
    <p>
        Tribute Info about the character I have been talking and writing about for so long without
        having any clue about his identity. The truth is, I could have possibly
        written a Lorem Ipsum but that would not be that much convenient. Composing (or simply writing)
        a text by myself will help me, - I think-, keeping in mind the different tags and their 
        positions in the document HTML.
