#### Node.js
**Node.js** is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

**Node.js** lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.

Consequently, **Node.js** represents a "_JavaScript everywhere_" [[programming paradigm|]], unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts

#### Front-end & Back-end
* <u>In software engineering</u>, the terms front-end and back-end refer to the separation of concerns between the **_presentation layer_** (front-end) and the **_data access layer_**(back-end) of a piece of software, or the physical infrastructure or hardware.
* <u>In the client-server model</u>, the client is usually considered the front-end and the server is considered the back-end.

#### Dynamic Web Pages
   ##### Server-side dynamic web page:
   is a web page whose construction is controlled by an application server processing server-side scripts.
   ##### Client-side dynamic web page
   processes the web page using HTML scripting running in the browser as it loads.
   --> JavaScript and other scripting languages determine the way the HTML in the received page is parsed into the **Document Object Model** (**DOM**)
