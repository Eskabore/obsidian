# State

In IT and CS, a system is described as **stateful** if it is designed to remember preceding events or user interactions[^1]; the remembered information is called the **state** of the system.

Examples
---

- To change the channel of a TV, the user usually presses a "channel up" or "channel down" button on the remote control, which sends a coded message to the set. In order to calculate the new channel that the user desires, the digital tuner in the television must have stored in it the number of the _current channel_ it is on. It then adds one or subtracts one from this number to get the number for the new channel.
- The **state** of a [microprocessor] is the contents of all the memory elements in it: the [accumulators], [storage registers], [data caches], and [flags]. When computers such as laptops go into a [hibernation mode] to save energy by shutting down the processor, the state of the processor is stored on the computer's [hard disk], so it can be restored when the computer comes out of hibernation, and the processor can take up operations where it left off.
