## Canvas

### Canvas API

The **Canvas API** provides a means for drawing graphics via [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and the [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) [`<canvas>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas) element. Among other things, it can be used for animation, game graphics, data visualization, photo manipulation, and real-time video processing.

The Canvas API largely focuses on 2D graphics. The [WebGL API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API), which also uses the `<canvas>` element, draws hardware-accelerated 2D and 3D graphics.

##### [Basic example](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API#basic_example "Permalink to Basic example")

This simple example draws a green rectangle onto a canvas.

###### [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API#html "Permalink to HTML")

```html
<canvas id="canvas"></canvas>
```

###### JavaScript

The [`Document.getElementById()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById) method gets a reference to the HTML `<canvas>` element. Next, the [`HTMLCanvasElement.getContext()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/getContext) method gets that element's context—the thing onto which the drawing will be rendered.

The actual drawing is done using the [`CanvasRenderingContext2D`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D) interface. The [`fillStyle`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/fillStyle "fillStyle") property makes the rectangle green. The [`fillRect()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/fillRect "fillRect()") method places its top-left corner at (10, 10), and gives it a size of 150 units wide by 100 tall.

```js
const canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");
const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

ctx.fillStyle = "green";
ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 150, 100);
```

### Drawing shapes with canvas

Now that we have set up our [canvas environment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Basic_usage), we can get into the details of how to draw on the canvas. By the end of this article, you will have learned how to draw rectangles, triangles, lines, arcs and curves, providing familiarity with some of the basic shapes. Working with paths is essential when drawing objects onto the canvas and we will see how that can be done.

##### [The grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Drawing_shapes#the_grid "Permalink to The grid")

Before we can start drawing, we need to talk about the canvas grid or **coordinate space**. Our HTML skeleton from the previous page had a canvas element 150 pixels wide and 150 pixels high.

>  ![Canvas grid with a blue square demonstrating coordinates and axes.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Drawing_shapes/canvas_default_grid.png)

Normally 1 unit in the grid corresponds to 1 pixel on the canvas. The origin of this grid is positioned in the _top left_ corner at coordinate (0,0). All elements are placed relative to this origin. So the position of the top left corner of the blue square becomes x pixels from the left and y pixels from the top, at coordinate (x,y). Later in this tutorial we'll see how we can translate the origin to a different position, rotate the grid and even scale it, but for now we'll stick to the default.

##### [Drawing rectangles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Drawing_shapes#drawing_rectangles "Permalink to Drawing rectangles")

Unlike [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SVG), [`<canvas>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas) only supports two primitive shapes: rectangles and paths (lists of points connected by lines). All other shapes must be created by combining one or more paths. Luckily, we have an assortment of path drawing functions which make it possible to compose very complex shapes.

First let's look at the rectangle. There are three functions that draw rectangles on the canvas:

[`fillRect(x, y, width, height)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/fillRect "fillRect(x, y, width, height)")

Draws a filled rectangle.

[`strokeRect(x, y, width, height)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/strokeRect "strokeRect(x, y, width, height)")

Draws a rectangular outline.

[`clearRect(x, y, width, height)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/clearRect "clearRect(x, y, width, height)")

Clears the specified rectangular area, making it fully transparent.
> Each of these three functions takes the same parameters. `x` and `y` specify the position on the canvas (relative to the origin) of the top-left corner of the rectangle. `width` and `height` provide the rectangle's size.

> [!Info] Keep in Mind
>  Each of these three functions takes the same parameters. `x` and `y` specify the position on the canvas (relative to the origin) of the top-left corner of the rectangle. `width` and `height` provide the rectangle's size.

*Below is the `draw()` function from the previous page, but now it is making use of these three functions.*

##### Rectangular shape example

```js
function draw() {
  const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
  if (canvas.getContext) {
    const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

    ctx.fillRect(25, 25, 100, 100);
    ctx.clearRect(45, 45, 60, 60);
    ctx.strokeRect(50, 50, 50, 50);
  }
}
```
