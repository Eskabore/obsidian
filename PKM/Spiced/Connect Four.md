Your game can look and work however you like but it must follow these basic rules.

1.  The board has six rows and seven columns
    
2.  Two players take turns selecting a column to drop their checker into
    
3.  When a player wins, a message appears to announce the victory
    
4.  After a player wins, it should be possible to reset the game and play again
    
5.  The gameplay should involve at least one animation (for example, the checkers could fall into their slot rather than just appear instantaneously)
