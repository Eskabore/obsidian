## Social Network - PART IV

**First Steps:**
- Replaced <Logo /> with top-level <App />
- <App /> GET specific data about user
- '/user' returns looged-in user's info
- All requested user's info are passed to App in the'componentDidMount' method.

**Establish <PrifilePic />**
- <App /> contains _other components_:
     - <\Logo />
     - <\ProfilePic />
     - <\Uploader />

- ProfilePic displays image with user first & last name using {props..}
- If  there  is no `profilePicUrl`, a default user image should be displayed.

**Image Upload**
The _**<Uploader />**_: the component that I have found the most challenging to implement so far. Thanks to its implementation, I can know say that I understand how to 'convert' a component
 from 'Vue to 'React.js'.
 Nevertheless, therte are several, if not _many_ ways to implement a modal, and from them, even more ways to adapt one's code.

- Theecomponent displays a modal tganks to an 'uploaderIsVisble()' state's property.
- After an upload, it sets/renders new picture as new user's standard picture.
