## Social Network PART - 8

## Friend Button
- Single component that appaear ONLY as  a child of <\OtherProfile\/>
## Database

To drive this feature, data must be stored in a way that makes it possible to answer the following questions:

1.  Is there an existing friend request between a given pair of users?
    
2.  If there is a request, has it been accepted?
    
3.  If there is a request and it has not been accepted, who is the sender and who is the receiver?
    

A simple way to accomplish this would be to **create a table for friend requests that has columns** for the id of the sender, the id of the recipient, and a boolean indicating whether or not the request has been accepted. When one user sends another a friend request, a row would be inserted with the ids of the sender and receiver in the appropriate columns and the boolean set to false. When a user accepts a friend request, the appropriate row would be updated to set the boolean to true. When a user unfriends or cancels a pending request, the row for the request can be deleted (deleting these rows means that we will lose potentially valuable historical information, but that is probably acceptable for our purposes).
## `FriendButton`

TheÂ `FriendButton`Â component will have to be passed a prop containing the id of the user whose profile it is appearing on so that it can make a request to retrieve the information it needs to render correctly when it mounts. That is,Â `OtherProfile`Â must pass it the id that is in the url.

In addition to the GET request it makes when it mounts,Â `FriendButton`Â will have to make POST requests whenever it is clicked. The POST request it makes must be determined by the current state.

The logic for determining what the button should say and what should happen when it is clicked goes likes this:

![[Pasted image 20221211194028.png|500]]

This determination will have to be made every time the component mounts and every time the user causes a state change by clicking the button. It is possible to locate the bulk of the code for making this determination on the server by having the GET and POST routes respond with a flag indicating what the button should say and do. Alternatively, the server can respond to the GET and POST routes with the current information from the database, leaving it to theÂ `FriendButton`Â itself to do all of the logic.

## Express Routes

One GET route and at least one POST route will be required.

The GET route should send back to the client the information that is required for theÂ `FriendButton`Â to render when it mounts.

The POST route(s) should send back a similar response after performing the appropriateÂ `INSERT`,Â `UPDATE`, orÂ `DELETE`Â query.

If you have just one POST route, you must include in the request enough information for the route to determine what query to do. If instead you want to have one route per query, you would only need to have three routes since the action for canceling a request and ending a friendship is the same.

## Testing

One of the hardest things about this part is confirming that the button is working correctly. Manual testing requires logging in as different users either sequentially or with multiple browsers at the same time. The site doesn't look terribly different for different users so it can get quite confusing.

Writing tests with Jest and React Testing Library can be very helpful here. In fact, this may be a good situation to try out a test-driven approach in which you write the tests for the component first and then write the code for the component to make the tests pass.

## DB table

```sql
CREATE TABLE friendships (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    sender_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    recipient_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    accepted BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT current_timestamp
);
```

## example query

```js
module.exports.findFriendship = (user1, user2) => {
    const query = `
        SELECT * FROM friendships
        WHERE (sender_id = $1 AND recipient_id = $2)
        OR (sender_id = $2 AND recipient_id = $1)`;
    return db.query(query, [user1, user2]);
};
```

## possible proceeding

There are a lot of pieces here. Here are some suggestions.

1.  [database] first, build all the database stuff.
2.  [GET route] check that querying a friendship gives the expected result
3.  [button] now start building your button component. But know that it's not going to be complete yet!
4.  Does it show 'Request friendship'?
5.  [POST route] now build and test the route to request (create) a new friendship. You can test with Postman/Insomnia!
6.  [button] Once you're sure the route works, build the behavior in the button to request a new friendship!
7.  Test: ensure the text on the button changes once you have created a new request - for both users!
8.  etc.
