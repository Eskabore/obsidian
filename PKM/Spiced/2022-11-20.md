## [`<input type="file">`]

[`<input>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) elements with **`type="file"`** let the user choose one or more files from their device storage. Once chosen, the files can be uploaded to a server using [form submission](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms), or manipulated using JavaScript code and [the File API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_API/Using_files_from_web_applications).


## [Unique file type specifiers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file#unique_file_type_specifiers)

A **unique file type specifier** is a string that describes a type of file that may be selected by the user in an [`<input>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) element of type `file`. Each unique file type specifier may take one of the following forms:

-   A valid case-insensitive filename extension, starting with a period (".") character. For example: `.jpg`, `.pdf`, or `.doc`.
-   A valid MIME type string, with no extensions.
-   The string `audio/*` meaning "any audio file".
-   The string `video/*` meaning "any video file".
-   The string `image/*` meaning "any image file".

## MIME types (IANA media types)

A **media type** (also known as a **Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions or MIME type**) indicates the nature and format of a document, file, or assortment of bytes. MIME types are defined and standardized in IETF's [RFC 6838](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6838).

The [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)](https://www.iana.org/) is responsible for all official MIME types, and you can find the most up-to-date and complete list at their [Media Types](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) page.

## [Structure of a MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types#structure_of_a_mime_type)

A MIME type most-commonly consists of just two parts: a _type_ and a _subtype_, separated by a slash (`/`) — with no whitespace between:

`type/subtype
`
The **_type_** represents the general category into which the data type falls, such as `video` or `text`.

The **_subtype_** identifies the exact kind of data of the specified type the MIME type represents. For example, for the MIME type `text`, the subtype might be `plain` (plain text), `html` ([HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML) source code), or `calendar` (for iCalendar/`.ics`) files.

Each type has its own set of possible subtypes. A MIME type always has both a type and a subtype, **_never just one or the other_**.

An optional **parameter** can be added to provide additional details:
`type/subtype;parameter=value`
For example, for any MIME type whose main type is `text`, you can add the optional `charset` parameter to specify the character set used for the characters in the data. If no `charset` is specified, the default is [ASCII](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/ASCII) (`US-ASCII`) unless overridden by the [user agent's](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent) settings. To specify a UTF-8 text file, the MIME type `text/plain;charset=UTF-8` is used.

MIME types are case-insensitive but are traditionally written in lowercase. The parameter values can be case-sensitive.

### [Types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types#types)

There are two classes of type: **discrete** and **multipart**. Discrete types are types which represent a single file or medium, such as a single text or music file, or a single video. A multipart type is one which represents a document that's comprised of multiple component parts, each of which may have its own individual MIME type; or, a multipart type may encapsulate multiple files being sent together in one transaction. For example, multipart MIME types are used when attaching multiple files to an email.

#### Discrete types

The discrete types currently registered with the IANA are:

`application`

Any kind of binary data that doesn't fall explicitly into one of the other types; either data that will be executed or interpreted in some way or binary data that requires a specific application or category of application to use. Generic binary data (or binary data whose true type is unknown) is `application/octet-stream`. Other common examples include `application/pdf`, `application/pkcs8`, and `application/zip`. [(Registration at IANA)](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml#application)

`audio`

Audio or music data. Examples include `audio/mpeg`, `audio/vorbis`. [(Registration at IANA)](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml#audio)

`example`

Reserved for use as a placeholder in examples showing how to use MIME types. These should never be used outside of sample code listings and documentation. `example` can also be used as a subtype; for instance, in an example related to working with audio on the web, the MIME type `audio/example` can be used to indicate that the type is a placeholder and should be replaced with an appropriate one when using the code in the real world.

`font`

Font/typeface data. Common examples include `font/woff`, `font/ttf`, and `font/otf`. [(Registration at IANA)](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml#font)

`image`

Image or graphical data including both bitmap and vector still images as well as animated versions of still image formats such as animated [GIF](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/gif) or APNG. Common examples are `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, and `image/svg+xml`. [(Registration at IANA)](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml#image)

`model`

Model data for a 3D object or scene. Examples include `model/3mf` and `model/vrml`. [(Registration at IANA)](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml#model)

`text`

Text-only data including any human-readable content, source code, or textual data such as comma-separated value (CSV) formatted data. Examples include: `text/plain`, `text/csv`, and `text/html`. [(Registration at IANA)](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml#text)

`video`

Video data or files, such as MP4 movies (`video/mp4`). [(Registration at IANA)](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml#video)

For text documents without a specific subtype, `text/plain` should be used. Similarly, for binary documents without a specific or known subtype, `application/octet-stream` should be used.

#### Multipart types

**Multipart** types indicate a category of document broken into pieces, often with different MIME types; they can also be used — especially in email scenarios — to represent multiple, separate files which are all part of the same transaction. They represent a **composite document**.

Except for `multipart/form-data`, used in the [`POST`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST) method of [HTML Forms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms), and `multipart/byteranges`, used with [`206`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/206) `Partial Content` to send part of a document, HTTP doesn't handle multipart documents in a special way: the message is transmitted to the browser (which will likely show a "Save As" window if it doesn't know how to display the document).

There are two multipart types:

`message`

A message that encapsulates other messages. This can be used, for instance, to represent an email that includes a forwarded message as part of its data, or to allow sending very large messages in chunks as if it were multiple messages. Examples include `message/rfc822` (for forwarded or replied-to message quoting) and `message/partial` to allow breaking a large message into smaller ones automatically to be reassembled by the recipient. [(Registration at IANA)](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml#message)

`multipart`

Data that consists of multiple components which may individually have different MIME types. Examples include `multipart/form-data` (for data produced using the [`FormData`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) API) and `multipart/byteranges` (defined in [RFC 7233, section 5.4.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7233#section-5.4.1) and used with [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP)'s [`206`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/206) "Partial Content" response returned when the fetched data is only part of the content, such as is delivered using the [`Range`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Range) header). [(Registration at IANA)](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml#multipart)

### FileList

An object of this type is returned by the `files` property of the HTML [`<input>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) element; this lets you access the list of files selected with the `<input type="file">` element. It's also used for a list of files dropped into web content when using the drag and drop API; see the [`DataTransfer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DataTransfer) object for details on this usage.
