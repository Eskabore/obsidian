#### Practice

**Query:** 

Update the table shows,
by setting the column 'table'
to capitalize the first letter
of each word
of each string
where string is separated by space

```sql
SELECT * FROM shows WHERE title LIKE ?, "%" + ' ' + "%" AND UPDATE


SELECT people.name, people.phone_number, people.license_plate
FROM people
JOIN atm_transactions ON people.id = atm_transactions.id
JOIN bakery_security_logs ON people.license_plate = bakery_security_logs.license_plate
WHERE atm_transactions.year = 2021 AND atm_transactions.month = 7 AND atm_transactions.day = 28 
AND atm_transactions.atm_location = 'Leggett Street' AND atm_transactions.transaction_type = 'withdraw' 
AND bakery_security_logs.year = 2021 AND bakery_security_logs.month = 7 AND bakery_security_logs.day = 28 
AND bakery_security_logs.hour = 10 AND bakery_security_logs.minute BETWEEN 15 AND 25 AND bakery_security_logs.activity = 'exit'
