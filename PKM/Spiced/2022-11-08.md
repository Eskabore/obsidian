==**CREATE TABLE**== 
```sql
CREATE TABLE cities (
    id SERIAL primary key,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    state VARCHAR(255),
    country VARCHAR
);
```

```
The `SERIAL` type is really an integer but one that will increment with each row that is added, guaranteeing that each row has a unique primary key.

The `VARCHAR` is for text of a length that is not predetermined. The parenthetical number 255 in the example above specifies the maximum length to allow.

`NOT NULL` indicates that the name field is required.
 It is possible to change a table after it has been created, but this can be problematic if there is already a lot of data in the table.

```sql
ALTER TABLE cities ADD COLUMN population INTEGER;
```

You can also remove columns.

```sql
ALTER TABLE cities DROP COLUMN state;
```
## Creating, reading, updating, and deleting data

To add rows to a table you use an `INSERT` statement, specifying the name of the table and the names of the columns you are inserting data into as well as the values for each column.

```sql
INSERT INTO cities (name, country, population) VALUES ('Berlin', 'Germany', 3610156);
INSERT INTO cities (name, country, population) VALUES ('Hamburg', 'Germany', 1774242);
INSERT INTO cities (name, country, population) VALUES ('Munch', 'Germany', 1450381);
INSERT INTO cities (name, country, population) VALUES ('Tokyo', 'Japan', 13617445);
INSERT INTO cities (name, country, population) VALUES ('Sydney', 'Australia', 4921000);
```

To update a row or rows, you use an `UPDATE` statement.

```sql
UPDATE cities SET name = 'Munich' WHERE name = 'Munch';
```

The `WHERE` clause performs a query to find the row or rows to update.

To delete a row or rows, you use `DELETE`.

```sql
DELETE FROM cities WHERE country <> 'Germany';
```

(The `<>` in the example above means 'not equal'.)

`SELECT` statements perform queries.

```sql
SELECT * FROM cities;

 id |  name   | country | population
----+---------+---------+------------
  1 | Berlin  | Germany |    3610156
  2 | Hamburg | Germany |    1774242
  3 | Munich  | Germany |    1450381
```

You can specify the fields you want to see in the result and have them appear with a different name that you specify with `AS`.

```sql
SELECT name AS town, population AS citizens FROM cities;

  town   | citizens
---------+----------
 Berlin  |  3610156
 Hamburg |  1774242
 Munich  |  1450381
```

You can use a `WHERE` clause to get a more specific set of results.

```sql
SELECT * FROM cities WHERE id < 2;

 id |  name  | country | population
----+--------+---------+------------
  1 | Berlin | Germany |    3610156
```

### Exercises

```SQL
CREATE TABLE actors (
id primary key,
Name VARCHAR (32) NOT NULL
Age INTEGER
Number INTEGER (32)
)
```

```sql
INSERT INTO actors (name, Age, Number) VALUES ('Leonardo DiCaprio', 41, 1)
INSERT INTO actors (name, Age, Number) VALUES ('Jennifer Lawrence', 25, 1)
INSERT INTO actors (name, Age, Number) VALUES ('Samuel L. Jackson', 67, 0)
INSERT INTO actors (name, Age, Number) VALUES ('Meryl Streep', 66, 3)
INSERT INTO actors (name, Age, Number) VALUES ('John Cho', 43, 0)

```

-   Which actors have more than one oscar?
```SQL
SELECT name FROM actors WHERE Number > 0; 
```

-   Which actors are older than 30 years old?
```sql
SELECT name FROM actors WHERE Age > 30;
```
