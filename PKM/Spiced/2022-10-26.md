# Same-origin policy
In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing "Computing"), the **same-origin policy** (sometimes abbreviated as **SOP**) is an important concept in the web application [security model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security_model "Computer security model"). Under the policy, a [web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser_engine "Web browser engine") permits scripts contained in a first web page to access data in a second web page, but only if both web pages have the same _origin_.

 An origin is defined as a combination of [URI scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier "Uniform Resource Identifier"), [host name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname "Hostname"), and [port number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking) "Port (computer networking)"). This policy prevents a malicious script on one page from obtaining access to sensitive data on another web page through that page's [Document Object Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model "Document Object Model").
 
This mechanism bears a particular significance for modern web applications that extensively depend on [HTTP cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie "HTTP cookie")[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy#cite_note-httpcookierfc-1) to maintain authenticated user sessions, as servers act based on the HTTP cookie information to reveal sensitive information or take state-changing actions.
. A strict separation between content provided by unrelated sites must be maintained on the client-side to prevent the loss of data confidentiality or integrity.
It is very important to remember that the same-origin policy applies only to scripts. This means that resources such as images, CSS, and dynamically-loaded scripts can be accessed across origins via the corresponding HTML tags[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy#cite_note-2) (with fonts being a notable exception[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy#cite_note-3)). Attacks take advantage of the fact that the same origin policy does not apply to HTML tags.


## Read access to sensitive cross-origin responses via reusable authentication [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Same-origin_policy&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Read access to sensitive cross-origin responses via reusable authentication")

The same-origin policy protects against reusing authenticated sessions across origins. The following example illustrates a potential security risk that could arise without the same-origin policy. Assume that a user is visiting a banking website and doesn't log out. Then, the user goes to another site that has malicious JavaScript code that requests data from the banking site. Because the user is still logged in on the banking site, the malicious code could do anything the user could do on the banking site. For example, it could get a list of the user's last transactions, create a new transaction, etc. This is because, in the original spirit of a world wide web, browsers are required to tag along authentication details such as session cookies and platform-level kinds of the Authorization request header to the banking site based on the domain of the banking site.

The bank site owners would expect that regular browsers of users visiting the malicious site do not allow the code loaded from the malicious site access the banking session cookie or platform-level authorization. While it is true that JavaScript has no direct access to the banking session cookie, it could still send and receive requests to the banking site with the banking site's session cookie. Same Origin Policy was introduced as a requirement for security-minded browsers to deny read access to responses from across origins, with the assumption that the majority of users choose to use compliant browsers. The policy does not deny writes. Counteracting the abuse of the write permission requires additional [CSRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery "Cross-site request forgery") protections by the target sites.
