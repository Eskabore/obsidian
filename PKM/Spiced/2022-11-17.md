# Vue:

  
## Attribute Binding:
In Vue, mustaches are only used for text **interpolation**.
To bind an attribute to a dynamic value, we use the `v-bind` **_directive_**:
```js
<div v-bind:id="dynamicId"></div>
```

#### ### Shorthand[#](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-syntax.html#shorthand)

Because `v-bind` is so commonly used, it has a dedicated shorthand syntax:
```js
<div :id="dynamicId"></div>
```

- A **directive** is special attribute that starts with the `v-` prefix.
> They are part of the Vue template syntax.
- 'directive' values are JavaScript expressions that have access to the component's state.

## Event Listeners
We listen to DOM events using the `v-on` direvtive
```js
<button v-on:click="increment">{{ count }}</button>

```
**NB:** [Template Syntax](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-syntax.html)



### Notes:

- State that can trigger updates when changed are considered **reactive**. In Vue, reactive state is held in components.
> We can declare reactive state using the `data` component option, which should be a function that returns an object:

```js
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      message: 'Hello World!'
    }
  }
}
```

### Definitions: 

#### **SFC**:
An SFC is a reusable self-contained block of code that encapsulates HTML, CSS and JavaScript that belong together, written inside a `.vue` file.

####  Declarative Rendering:


At the core of Vue Native is a system that enables us to declaratively render data using straightforward template syntax:
```js
<template>  
  <view>  
    <text>{{ message }}</text>  
  </view>  
</template>
```
<template>  
  <view>  
    <text>{{ message }}</text>  
  </view>  
</template>  
<template>  
  <view>  
    <text>{{ message }}</text>  
  </view>  
</template>
```js
<script>  
export default {  
  data: function() {  
    return {  
      message: "Hello World"  
    };  
  }  
};  
</script>
```
In **declarative rendering**, **==an element pulls information down from only state and props==**. The concept of declarative rendering has a counterpart in the world of writing and sentence composition.

We have already created our very first `Vue Native` app! This looks pretty similar to rendering a template string, but under the hood a lot of work is being done. The data and the native UI elements are now linked, and everything is now **[reactive](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals.html#:~:text=Declaring%20Reactive%20State)**.

## What is State Management?

**Every** Vue **component** instance manages its own reactive state.
```js
<script>
export default {
// state
data() {
return {
count: 0
}
},
//actions 
methods: {
increment() {
this.count++
}
}
}
</script>

<!-- View --> 
<template>
{{ count }}
</template>
```

It is a self-contained unit with the following parts:

-   The **state**, the source of truth that drives our app;
-   The **view**, a declarative mapping of the **state**;
-   The **actions**, the possible ways the state could change in reaction to user inputs from the **view**.

This is a simple representation of the concept of "one-way data flow":

However, the simplicity starts to break down when we have **multiple components that share a common state**:
1.  Multiple views may depend on the same piece of state.
2.  Actions from different views may need to mutate the same piece of state.
