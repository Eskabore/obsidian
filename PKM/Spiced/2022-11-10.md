## B-crypt

#### wikipedia [link](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt)
- hashSync
-
```js
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

const password = "32445";

const salt = bcrypt.genSaltSync();
console.log(salt);

const hash = bcrypt.hashSync(password, salt);

console.log(hash)
```

You will need to add a `users` table to your database. The table should have columns for id (the primary key), first name, last name, email address, and the hashed password. You may also want to add a timestamp column to record the time at which the user was created.

You should also change the `signatures` table so that it has a column for the user id. You need to be able to map signatures to users and users to signatures.

Both the registration and log in forms can have several errors so you have to be able to reload them with error information displayed.

First name, last name, email address, and password should all be required fields. Email addresses must be unique. This should be enforced by a [constraint](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/sql-createtable.html) on the column.



```sql
CREATE TABLE user(
id primary key,
fName VARCHAR NOT NULL
lName VARCHAR NOT NULL
signature text NOT NULL
user_id INTEGER NOT NULL

)
```


>[!Notes]  AFTER log in give `req.session` ==> a property of usert_id


*loggout* user by redirect to '/loggout'
